This folder contains 2 individual projects.

1. backend - A Typescript Express server that only returns one endpoint
2. frontend - A React front-end webpage that displays data retrieved in the backend, and displayed on a line chart created using react-chartjs-2.

These applications must be run in separate terminals. How to run the applications:

In terminal 1 please run the commands:
`cd backend`, `npm install`, `npm run start`

In terminal 2 please run the commands:
`cd frontend`, `npm install`, `npm run start`

While both applications are running you should see a performance metric dashboard displaying the data that is retrieved from the backend application.
