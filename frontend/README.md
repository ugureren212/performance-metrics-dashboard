A simple frontend React and Typescript web page.

Data is retrieved from the backend application and is plotted on a line graph created in react-chartjs-2.

To install dependecies you must be in the "/frontend" folder directory.

After, run `npm install` and then run `npm run start` to start the server.

Note: The backend server must be running for the frontend web page to work correctly.
